;; Name : Ayo 
;; File : Personalitycore
;; File Purpose : The Personalitycore file ontains the code that determines individual peopleâ€™s personality based on their choices. 
;; 					This code is largely governed by a set of logic rules; and most of the inferences here are made by the computer. 
;; Version : 1.0
;; Description : An artificially intelligent logic based algorithm that takes
;;					inputs about people to logically deduce their tastes, personality,
;;					likes, dislikes and eventually their significant other.
;; Language : Clojure

;; Defining the namespace and delaring the use of other files

;; It is inferred that one's personality is largely determined by the music they like to listen
;; Based on this theory, the rules of personality are set as follows:
;;
;; 1. melancholic people like electronic music
;; 2. choleric people like screaming and rap music
;; 3. phlegmatic people like bright and happy music
;; 4. sanguime people like pop music
;;
;; The databse below defines boys' and girls' choices
;; so the the AI can best define which people have the same personalities.
